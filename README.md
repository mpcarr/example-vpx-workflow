# example-vpx-workflow

Alernative approch to scripting in VPX.

Dependencies:

Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)
Grunt (https://gruntjs.com/)

Clone the repository and install the node modules.

    npm i

run

    npm run watch

This will start grunt which will watch for file changes and compile the tablescript.vbs file in the dest folder. (this is what the vpx table reads on launch).
